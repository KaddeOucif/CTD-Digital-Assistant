## Digital Assistant - Building a Digital Assistant for your business ##

In this lab, you'll learn how to work with skills and digital assistants in Oracle Digital Assistant;
-	A **skill** is an individual chatbot that is focused on a specific set of capabilities (e.g. helping customers order food from a specific restaurant).
- **A digital assistant** is a master chatbot containing multiple specialized skills. When a user engages with the digital assistant, the digital assistant evaluates the user input and routes the conversation to the appropriate skill.
