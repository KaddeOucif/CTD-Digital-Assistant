## Digital Assistant - Building a Digital Assistant for your business ##

In this lab, you'll learn how to work with skills and digital assistants in Oracle Digital Assistant;
-	A **skill** is an individual chatbot that is focused on a specific set of capabilities (e.g. helping customers order food from a specific restaurant).
- **A digital assistant** is a master chatbot containing multiple specialized skills. When a user engages with the digital assistant, the digital assistant evaluates the user input and routes the conversation to the appropriate skill. You can populate your digital assistant with skills from the Skill Store and with skills you have designed yourself.
